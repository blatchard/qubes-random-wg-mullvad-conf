# qubes-random-wg-mullvad-conf
Simple script I use to select a random wireguard conf and connect to it when starting a qube, also additional script to switch country of already running qube, and another to start a wireguard connection if one isn't present (in an appVM with wg configs).

I'm a totally new member of github, and very enthuastic about qubes, linux in general and network security.  This code is by no means finished, as I'm sure some of it can be achieved in a more unified way.

One very nice thing about it is that it works in disposable vm's, so if an appVM has been set up with, for example an arkenfox configured firefox, with favourites, plugins etc, and then been set to be its own DVM, it will connect to a different wireguard connection on every instance and completely erased afterwards.  They can also be used as proxy appVM's for any qube if not ran as DVM.

Pre-requisites:
must download wireguard configuration files from mullvad of countries you wish to connect to (or ideally, ALL of their wireguard confs in one zip - then remove any that are not wanted) and extract them to /rw/usrconfig/etc/wireguard.  I do chmod 640 ./wireguard after this.  Then append the 4 lines in rc.local to /rw/config/rc.local.

You then need to edit the wg-quick (in fedora templateVM [ sudo nano /usr/bin/wg-quick ] asssuming that this template is where you installed wireguard-tools and change the line in the "parse_options()" function:

[[ $CONFIG_FILE =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_=+.-]{1,15}$ ]] && CONFIG_FILE="/etc/wireguard/$CONFIG_FILE.conf"

to

[[ $CONFIG_FILE =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_=+.-]{1,15}$ ]] && CONFIG_FILE="/rw/usrlocal/etc/wireguard/$CONFIG_FILE.conf"


the only reason for this, is so that if you have to for any reason, you can run wg-quick up mullvad-??* or wg-quick down mullvad=??* and it will work without the entire path.  The rc.local change will work on qube start regardless as will the change.sh (can be run from any directory with sudo)
